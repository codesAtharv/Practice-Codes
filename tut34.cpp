//Inheritance
//Reusability is very important feature of OOPs
// C++ we can reuse a class and add aditional freature to it 
//Reusing class saves time and money
// Reuing already tested and debugged class will save lots of effots of developing and dbugging 
// we can reuse proprties of existing class by inheritting from it

//forms  of inheritance Single inheritance, Multiple Inheritance, Hierarchical Inheritance , Multilevel Inheritance, Hybrid Inheritance

 /*Single Inheritance
 ony derived class made using only Base class
 
    A --> B (reads as B is Derived from A)
 */

 /*Multiple Inheritance
 A derived class with more than one base classes

    C is derived from A and B both
 */

 /* Hierarchical Inheritance
 Several derived class from a single base class
    
 B and C are derived from A only
 */
/*MultiLevel nheritance 
Deriving a class from already derived class

A --> B ---> C (C is derived from B which is further derived from A)
*/

/*Hybrid Inheritance
Combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritancfe
A class derived from two class as in multiple inheritance 

A gives B and C and further B and C give D
