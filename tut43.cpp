/*Constructure in inheritance or in derived class
 we can use constreure in derived class
 If base class have constructure which dont have any argument there is no need to of any constructure in derived class
 But if there are more argument in base class constructure derived class need to pass argument  to base class constructure
 if both base and derived class have constructure than base class construre exicuted first
 
 The constructure of virtual base class is invoked before nonvirtual base class
 If ther are multiple virtual base class then they will invoke in order they are declared*/
