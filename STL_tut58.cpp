/* STL-standard template library
It is already given libraries of c++
that we can use in our programs

Components of STL
1. Containers -> Stores data, use template classes
2. Algorithms -> Sorting , Scarding, Use template functions
3. Iterators  -> its objects that points to container , It is just like Pointers ,Connects algoritihms with containers


CONTAINERS
1. Sequence Containers-> Store data in Linear faction Ex- Vector, List, Queue 
2. Associative Containers->DIrect Access Ex- Tree, Set / Multiset, Map/Multimap  
3. Derived Containers-> real world modelling Ex- Stack, queue, priority queue


Sequence container
1. Vector -> Random access very fast compare to array , insetion/Deletion slow, Insetrion at end is fast
2. List -> Random access is slow, Inserion is fast and end is also fast and deleting is also same

Association containers -> all operation fast except random access

derived containers -> Depends -> Data Structure
